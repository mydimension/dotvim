# ABSTRACT: Exception objects thrown by Mason
__END__

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module creates the exception classes used by Mason.  Mason only throws
exception objects to communicate something specific to code catching the
exception; otherwise it is content to die with a string.

=head1 EXCEPTIONS

=over

=item Mason::Exception::Abort

The C<< $m->abort >> method was called.

Exceptions in this class contain the field C<aborted_value>.

=item Mason::Exception::TopLevelNotFound

The requested top level component passed to exec() could not be found. In a web
environment, this could be used to determine that a 404 should be returned.
